||| Implement PathSafe for container IDs
|||
||| Container ids are vectors of four characters. They are safe to
||| encode as paths, since each character must be a digit. Ordinary
||| barcodes cannot encode non-numeric characters, so anything other
||| than digits is unexpected.

||| How long a given food item is expected to last.

||| This is meant to capture the different representations of product
||| life which are used on packaged and unpackaged foods. From this we

||| prompt the user to take appropriate actions.

||| A container holds an amount of some food.

||| Each container has a unique ID assigned by the user.
|||
||| For each container, we track its type, lifetime, gross weight, and
||| tear weight.

||| This is the generic container, parameterized over the food
||| representation.
