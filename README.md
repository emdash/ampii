# A Meal Planner in Idris (Ampii)

## Intro

I wrote this app because I (a) wanted something like it for myself,
and (b) to help myself learn the dependently-typed langauge, Idris.

I am am relatively new to FP, and very new to Idris, so no doubt there
is plenty of room for improvement, and I welcome feedback on the
design.
