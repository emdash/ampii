# A Meal Planner in Idris

I want to help you cook the food that *you* want to eat.

Along the way, I'll help you track what food you have, what food to
buy, and what food you've been eating.

From that data, I will help you answer questions about your diet, and
hopefully make your time in the kitchen organized and joyful.

There is a french culinary term: [mise en
plas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), which translates
to "everything's in place". That might have been a good title for this
software, if I'd thought of it when I started. It is the guiding
principle beind AMPiI.

## What I ask of You

In exchange for this help, I'm going to ask you, *dear user* to do
some work. Not for me, but for *yourself*.

I'm going to ask you to track what's in your pantry and I'm going to
ask you to make some *minor* adjustments to your cooking habits.

Don't worry, I'll help you do this. It won't be that bad. That's my
job.

This software is to help *you* track *your* goals with precision. You
will benefit in proportion to to the work you put into it.

### Shared Data and How You Can Help

Here's what I don't want -- *your* data:

- your recipes
- your meal plans and menus
- your food journals

That's yours -- or perhaps even copyrighted material, of which you
partake under fair use. With AMPiI, all the above is always under your
direct control.

I will make a plea for you to voluntarily share *some* data: barcodes
and nutritional information from packaged foods, and (optionally)
photos you take thereof. This will help other users of my software
save time on data entry. You're not obliged to do this.

There are commercial and non-commercial food databases. None of them
completely serves the needs of AMPiI. Moreover, using these databases
imposes constraints, limitations, and potentially costs on my
software. I want to keep my software free to use, for anyone who wants
it. Integration with third-party nutritional databases shall remain
optional.

I recognize that the food we buy is very personal, and potentially
reveals a lot about you. If you choose to contribute food data, I
thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Note: at the time of writin, there's no way for you to even do
this. So, we will all cross that metaphorical bridge, as and when we
reach it.

## Some Helpful Tools

You can enter all this data manually. But your work will be much more
pleasant if you invest in some companion tools that you probably don't
have:
- a digital scale, with USB or Bluetooth input. [list of compatible scales](TBD)
- almost any barcode scanner [list of suggested models](TBD)

You may never have thought about owning tools like this before, and I
don't blame you. But it turns out that they can be bought both new and
used for modest sums. While by no means required, if you can afford
them, they are worth it.

In addition, you may also want to use:
- a USB webcam for taking photos
- a full keyboard, with a num-pad.

# A Word About Nutrition

I'm not a nutritionist, and this software doesn't provide nutritional
guidance.

This software only tries to help *you* reach the goals *you've* set
for yourself.

For convenience, the system defaults to tracking the standard
nutritional data often printed on packaged food, and ships with a
small database of commonly-available whole foods derived from public
sources. Be aware that these values are *very* approximate, and to the
greatest degree possible, rely on the most accurate data available to
you.

You are free to adapt the system to track any other data that is
relevant to your needs.

## AMPiI Doesn't Judge

Nutritional goals are *yours* to define, and AMPiI will let you
express them in detail, while providing feedback as to the degree to
which you've acheived them.

Beyond nutrition, AMPiI will also track your biometric data, to help
you determine whether your efforts are having the desired effect.

# Why not more automation? Why not use AI?

I believe we should do some things for ourselves. So often these days,
software is designed to promote distraction and mindlessness.

This is software does the opposite: aid focus and mindfullness. I want
to raise your awareness of the food in your life. And I especially
want to support those who cook from scratch.

## Why

I've long struggled to eat in a way that conforms to my
contemporaneous goals regarding diet, nutrition, health, and
values.

It's not just a question of willpower: it's also largely been a
failure to properly plan and execute.

Modern life is busy and stressful for everyone. The days of the
stay-at-home head-of-household are long gone. I can remember a time
when my parents would plan their weekly shopping on a legal
pad. They'd make maps of each grocery store, and optimize their
shopping trips to minimize time spent at each location. Who has time
for this anymore?

But we still need to eat. If there's one thing we should still do for
ourselves as often as possible, it's to prepare our own food. I feel
the modern cook could use some help, so they can focus on what matters
most: *the results*.

This system helps to automate the tasks I find most challenging,
without embracing ay specific ideology around cooking, nutrition, or
personal values. As a result, a fair amount of work is left to the
user. But the reward is a system that should evolve *with* the user,
fading in to the background over time, in a way that keeps the user
focused on what matters most in the present moment.
