# A Meal Planner in Idris

I want to help you cook the food that *you* want to eat.

Along the way, I'll help you track what food you have, what food to
buy, and what food you've been eating.

From that data, I will help you answer questions about your diet, and
hopefully make your time in the kitchen organized and joyful.

There is a french culinary term: [mise en
plas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), which translates
to "everything in place". That might have been a good name for this
software, if I'd thought of it when I started. In any case, you can
think of it as the guiding principle beind AMPiI.

## What I ask of You

In exchange for this help, I'm going to ask you, *dear user* to do
some work. Not for me, but for *yourself*.

I'm going to ask you to track what's in your pantry and I'm going to
ask you to make some *small* modifications to your cooking habits.

Don't worry, I'll help you do this. It won't be that bad. That's my job.

This software is to help *you* track *your* goals with precision. You
will benefit only in proportion to the work you put into it.

### Shared Data and How You Can Help

Here's what I won't ask your for: *your* data. I don't want
it. Well. Not all of it. Here's what I don't want:
- your recipes
- your meal plans and menus
- your food journals and dietary history

That's your personal information -- or perhaps even copyrighted
material. With AMPiI, these are always under your control.

I will make a plea for you to voluntarily share *some* data: barcodes
and nutritional information from packaged food, and (optionally)
photos you take of the packaging.

This will help other users of my software save time on data
entry. You're not obliged to do this.

There are commercial and non-commercial food databases. None of them
completely serves the needs of AMPiI. Moreover, using these databases
imposes constraints, limitations, and potentially costs on my
software. I want to keep my software free to use, for anyone who wants
it.

I recognize that the food we buy is very personal, and potentially
reveals a lot about you. If you choose to share, I thank you.

## Some Helpful Tools

You can enter all this data manually. But your work will be much more
pleasant if you invest in some companion tools that you probably don't
have:
- a digital scale, with USB or Bluetooth input. [list of compatible scales](TBD)
- almost a barcode scanner [list of suggested models](TBD)

You may never have thought about owning tools like this before, and I
don't blame you. But it turns out that they can be bought both new and
used for modest sums. While by no means required, if you can afford
them, they are worth it.

In addition, you may also want:
- a USB webcam for taking photos

# A Word About Nutrition

I'm not a nutritionist, and this software doesn't provide nutritional
guidance.

For convenience, the system defaults to tracking the standard
nutritional data often printed on packaged food, and has a small
database of whole foods derived from public sources.

You are free to adapt the system to track any other data that is
relevant to your needs.

# Why not more automation? Why not use AI?

I believe we should do some things for ourselves. So often these days,
software is designed to promote distraction and mindlessness.

This is software does the opposite: aid focus and mindfullness. I want
to raise your awareness of the food in your life.

## Why

I've long struggled to eat in a way that conforms to my needs
regarding diet, nutrition, health, and values. It's not just a
question of willpower: it's also largely been a failure to properly
plan and execute.

Modern life is busy and stressful for everyone. The days of the
stay-at-home head-of-household are long gone. But we still need to
eat. If there's one thing we should still do for ourselves as often as
possible, it's to prepare our own food. I feel the modern cook could
use some help.

This system helps to automate the tasks I find most challenging,
without requiring that one embrace anyone else's ideas about food, pay
a monthly fee, or in any other way *compromise* on one's approach to
diet and health.
