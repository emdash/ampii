I added broccoli to this, which I'm glad but would actually do it in the last 30-60 minutes next time. It was pretty mushy.

I added the stock and simmered it for about 2 hours on high. I added 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup lemon juice. I made the peanut sauce with the peanut butter, more lime and lemon juice and soy sauce (scant because it is so salty). I stirred the bell peppers in and the sauce and simmered another 1/2 hour. Use the toppings and serve over rice. Really really delicious. The homemade thai seasoning had sea salt, black pepper, garlic granules, onion powder, toasted cocoanut, chili pepper, cayenne, crystalized ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and hmmm, oh yeah cumin. This was good with the adjustments. I eliminated the cornstarch. The peanut butter thickens it nicely."

I also used a Kg of skinless Chicken THIGHS too, waay cheaper, and so tender! Just pulled the meat off of the bone around the 5 hour mark, took out the bones and added sauce. Oh and I reduced the amount of peanut butter to about 1/2 a cup. I made it with some instant rice spiced up with about a 1/4tsp of minced ginger(just a small squirt from one of those tubes) and 1/2 tsp minced garlic( again, tube stuff). I only had cashews and no green onions but with fresh cilantro from the garden and a few crushed cashews for texture, it was awesome!"

This recipe was a complete fail. It didn't smell good while cooking and the finished product was extremely unappealing visually for starters. If you check out some of the photos added for this recipe you will see what I mean. It was also completely lacking in taste. It was salty and way too much peanut butter (I even took into account other peoples posts and put 1/2 cup). The cornstarch turns this dish into a thick sludge type sauce. For anyone planning on trying this dish I would put 1 tablespoon of cornstarch MAX! I would also use a low sodium chicken broth to account for some of the saltiness (I think the soy sauce flavor is needed and should not be omitted to account for the salt content). I will never make this again."

I also used chicken thighs because I've had breasts dry out in my slow cooker, and threw in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies at the end to make up for the pepper/onion I left out.

The meat just fell off the bone and was pretty good with that sauce. For some reason I thought the sauce would be really thick, like gravy, but it wasn't--and it was pretty good. As other reviewers mentioned, the garnishes are pretty important--allows for an extra punch of flavor that this dish needs. Thanks for the recipe."

Come on.... Thai people consider 5 chilis for one bowl to be only a little spicy. We westerners who love Thai food will usually use 3 or 4 chilis per bowl."

Using chicken mince means no meat prep - and you can switch it out with literally any ground meat (beef, turkey, pork). It might not be authentic Thai ... but it's fast and 100% delicious!NOTE: Trick here is to work quickly so the sauce isn't all absorbed by the noodles which will make them bloated and clumpy. If your noodles do absorb all the sauce, just add a splash of water to thin it out.",

      "description": "Recipe video above. Thai Chicken Peanut Noodles is what you make when you&#39;ve got less than 15 minutes to get dinner on the table and you need a Thai fix! Using chicken mince means no meat prep - and you can switch it out with literally any ground meat (beef, turkey, pork). It might not be authentic Thai ... but it&#39;s fast and 100% delicious!NOTE: Trick here is to work quickly so the sauce isn&#39;t all absorbed by the noodles which will make them bloated and clumpy. If your noodles do absorb all the sauce, just add a splash of water to thin it out.",

    "name": "Chicken Manchurian",
    "description": "A stalwart of Desi Chinese cooking, chicken Manchurian is immensely popular at Chinese restaurants across South Asia. Nelson Wang, a third generation Chinese chef who was born in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), is credited with inventing the dish in Mumbai in the 1970s. This recipe comes from attempts at recreating the version served at Hsin Kuang in Lahore, Pakistan, in the late ’90s. At restaurants it’s almost always served on a sizzler platter, the tangy, sweet-and-sour sauce bubbling and thickening on its way to the table. Making it at home doesn’t compromise any of the punchy flavors. Velveting the chicken in egg and cornstarch means it’ll stay tender through the short cooking process; bell pepper and spring onions add freshness and crunch to the otherwise intense flavors from ketchup and chile-garlic sauce.",

      "description": "A stalwart of Desi Chinese cooking, chicken Manchurian is immensely popular at Chinese restaurants across South Asia. Nelson Wang, a third generation Chinese chef who was born in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), is credited with inventing the dish in Mumbai in the 1970s. This recipe comes from attempts at recreating the version served at Hsin Kuang in Lahore, Pakistan, in the late ’90s. At restaurants it’s almost always served on a sizzler platter, the tangy, sweet-and-sour sauce bubbling and thickening on its way to the table. Making it at home doesn’t compromise any of the punchy flavors. Velveting the chicken in egg and cornstarch means it’ll stay tender through the short cooking process; bell pepper and spring onions add freshness and crunch to the otherwise intense flavors from ketchup and chile-garlic sauce.",

Here, they are browned, then braised in a fragrant tomato-coconut broth flecked with ginger, garlic, cumin and cinnamon. The result is a rich, stew-like dish, which works nicely served over white rice. By cooking the rice as the chicken finishes braising, you can get everything on the table at the same time.

      "description": "Bone-in chicken thighs are a favorite go-to for weeknight meals, as they cook relatively quickly, are versatile and impart a lot of flavor in a short amount of time. Here, they are browned, then braised in a fragrant tomato-coconut broth flecked with ginger, garlic, cumin and cinnamon. The result is a rich, stew-like dish, which works nicely served over white rice. By cooking the rice as the chicken finishes braising, you can get everything on the table at the same time. A good squeeze of lime is not required, but it does give the dish a bright finish. Serve any remaining sauce at the table, with crusty bread for sopping.",

    "description": "Plantains are nutrient-rich starches that can sweeten as they cook, and, in many parts of the world, they find their way into the best stews and porridges. This recipe is based on “tomato eggs,” a dish popular in Lagos, Nigeria, and across West Africa. Tomato eggs can be made with yams or plantains, and here, firm yellow plantains work best because they hold their shape and texture while absorbing the flavors of the surrounding stew. It’s a perfect meal for days when you want something hot but not too heavy or filling. Any herbs you have on hand will work well, and the dish can be made vegan by substituting medium-firm or soft tofu for the eggs. \n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for The Veggie newsletter.",

      "description": "Plantains are nutrient-rich starches that can sweeten as they cook, and, in many parts of the world, they find their way into the best stews and porridges. This recipe is based on “tomato eggs,” a dish popular in Lagos, Nigeria, and across West Africa. Tomato eggs can be made with yams or plantains, and here, firm yellow plantains work best because they hold their shape and texture while absorbing the flavors of the surrounding stew. It’s a perfect meal for days when you want something hot but not too heavy or filling. Any herbs you have on hand will work well, and the dish can be made vegan by substituting medium-firm or soft tofu for the eggs. \n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.",

    "description": "This traditional Turkish egg dish of garlicky yogurt with poached eggs and a drizzle of spicy butter is rich, luscious and faintly smoky. Typically served as a meze among a spread of other dishes, it makes a light lunch or brunch that comes together in the time it takes to poach eggs. For your base, opt for Greek yogurt to mimic the thicker yogurt common in Turkey. Next, bloom Aleppo pepper in butter or olive oil. Also known as pul biber, it delivers about as much heat as chipotle, with smoky notes and a fruity flavor. This version of çilbir is adapted from Özlem Warren, a cookbook author and blogger. Though the dish is traditionally served without herbs, she recommends dill or parsley for a modern flourish.",

      "description": "This traditional Turkish egg dish of garlicky yogurt with poached eggs and a drizzle of spicy butter is rich, luscious and faintly smoky. Typically served as a meze among a spread of other dishes, it makes a light lunch or brunch that comes together in the time it takes to poach eggs. For your base, opt for Greek yogurt to mimic the thicker yogurt common in Turkey. Next, bloom Aleppo pepper in butter or olive oil. Also known as pul biber, it delivers about as much heat as chipotle, with smoky notes and a fruity flavor. This version of çilbir is adapted from Özlem Warren, a <a href=\"https://www.gbpublishing.co.uk/ozlemsturkishtable\">cookbook author</a> and <a href=\"https://ozlemsturkishtable.com/\">blogger</a>. Though the dish is traditionally served without herbs, she recommends dill or parsley for a modern flourish.",

    "name": "Creamy One-Pot Pasta With Chicken and Mushrooms",
    "description": "Cooking pasta the way you would make risotto may sound new and hip. But it’s at least old enough to have been demonstrated to me in Rome in 1976, and I imagine as old as pasta itself. In this method, the liquid is minimized: there’s no need for a gallon per pound of pasta. The liquid is added gradually to the pasta, which absorbs it completely and thereby retains its starch. This makes the pasta creamy and rich; it also gains the flavor of the stock. You can use pretty much any pasta shape you like, but timing will vary depending on size. This approach may seem like more work than making pasta in the ordinary way. But as the making of the “sauce” is integrated into the pasta-cooking, it really becomes a one-dish meal — as interesting as risotto, and even a bit quicker. Here is a combination of gemelli with mushrooms and chicken to get you started.",

      "description": "Cooking pasta the way you would make risotto may sound new and hip. But it’s at least old enough to have been demonstrated to me in Rome in 1976, and I imagine as old as pasta itself. In this method, the liquid is minimized: there’s no need for a gallon per pound of pasta. The liquid is added gradually to the pasta, which absorbs it completely and thereby retains its starch. This makes the pasta creamy and rich; it also gains the flavor of the stock. You can use pretty much any pasta shape you like, but timing will vary depending on size. This approach may seem like more work than making pasta in the ordinary way. But as the making of the “sauce” is integrated into the pasta-cooking, it really becomes a one-dish meal — as interesting as risotto, and even a bit quicker. Here is a combination of gemelli with mushrooms and chicken to get you started.",

Chickpeas are mashed in a creamy, rich lemon-tahini dressing, then mixed with crunchy celery and scallions for fresh bite. Earthy alfalfa sprouts, crisp lettuce, creamy avocado and sweet tomatoes bring contrasting textures and flavors to the sandwich. The chickpea salad can be made a few hours ahead and kept refrigerated. Any leftover salad makes a tasty dip served with tortilla chips or crackers. For a vegan alternative, omit the cheese for sandwiches that still boast layers of flavor.",

      "description": "This quick recipe makes simple canned chickpeas into a bold and hearty vegetarian meal. Chickpeas are mashed in a creamy, rich lemon-tahini dressing, then mixed with crunchy celery and scallions for fresh bite. Earthy alfalfa sprouts, crisp lettuce, creamy avocado and sweet tomatoes bring contrasting textures and flavors to the sandwich. The chickpea salad can be made a few hours ahead and kept refrigerated. Any leftover salad makes a tasty dip served with tortilla chips or crackers. For a vegan alternative, omit the cheese for sandwiches that still boast layers of flavor.",

There are many different types of kielbasa, but the smoked version typically found at American grocery stores is horseshoe-shaped and, when roasted, tastes a little like pepperoni. Feel free to play around with substitutions: You can use green or red cabbage for the Savoy, though the leaves won’t get quite as frizzled and golden. Instead of dill, chives or parsley can bring freshness. Instead of shallot, use scallions, red-pepper flakes or grated garlic for sharp heat. Instead of mustard, you could use horseradish, chopped pickles or sauerkraut for briny acidity.",

      "description": "This sheet-pan dinner of roasted kielbasa, caramelized cabbage and white beans marinated in a dill-and-red wine vinaigrette comes together in about a half-hour. There are many different types of kielbasa, but the smoked version typically found at American grocery stores is horseshoe-shaped and, when roasted, tastes a little like pepperoni. Feel free to play around with substitutions: You can use green or red cabbage for the Savoy, though the leaves won’t get quite as frizzled and golden. Instead of dill, chives or parsley can bring freshness. Instead of shallot, use scallions, red-pepper flakes or grated garlic for sharp heat. Instead of mustard, you could use horseradish, chopped pickles or sauerkraut for briny acidity.",

We love the peppers once they are macerated. Thinking about it we have almost treated this like a starter, just adding lime juice & fish sauce & brown sugar or peppers to maintain ratio of liquid to peppers. That container has been in the fridge since...whoa, I'm embarassed to admit - suffice it to say, a long time & it is REALLY Good! Great source of B vitamins & vitamin C as well!

I cut the recipe in half ( 2 lbs of eggplant) but found I still need the full amount of the egg mixture. I probably don’t quite have three cups of sauce but close. \nAs for greasy Parmesan cheese. Get some good parmesan, preferably Italian and it does not get greasy in cooking. That stuff in the green can is not Parmesan cheese. I fish fact most pretreated cheese contains cellulose (wood fiber) and other ingredients to keep it from asking an clumping. These things do nasty things when heated. \nSoaking eggplant for two hours in salted water? Yuck . There is probably some dish that requires this but crispy eggplant No!"

I add other things to my breadcrumbs like garlic powder and Tony Chachere's seasoning. Also, just throw away the measurements for this recipe. You don't need EXACTLY 1/2 a cup of cheese and EXACTLY 2 cups of sauce. Silly. Throw the sauce in the bottom of the pan until it's covered. Put your eggplant in, more sauce until they are covered and then as much darn cheese as you want. Play with the flavors YOU want to bring out. I really only look at the recipe for recommended cook temps and times."

      "Gather the ingredients.\nWash and dry the eggplants. Cut off the cap end and then slice the eggplants lengthwise into ¼-inch (½-cm) thick slices.\nArrange the slices on large trays or baking sheets lined with several layers of paper towels, and sprinkle them lightly with coarse salt on both sides. Set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour so the salt draws out the excess water. (You can also stack the slices in a large colander, with salt sprinkled between each layer, and set in a sink.) \nPat off the excess water and salt from the eggplant slices. Rinse them, then dry again with paper towels, pressing down to dry them thoroughly. Set aside.",
      "Gather the ingredients.\nIn a medium pot, heat the olive oil with the minced garlic and chopped onion.\nSauté over medium heat until the onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the tomato puree. Season to taste with salt (if you've salted the eggplant, go easy on the salt in the sauce, or omit it completely). Cover and simmer over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until the sauce is flavorful and slightly thickened.",
      "In a large skillet, heat about ¼-inch of vegetable oil over medium heat. Give the eggplant slices a final pat with paper towels to remove any excess water that may inhibit browning and cause oil splatter.\nFry the eggplant slices, 2 or 3 at a time, in the hot oil until well browned on each side, 3 to 5 minutes.\nAs the eggplant slices are removed from the oil, let them drain on a paper towel-lined plate or tray. Adjust the burner temperature and oil level as you fry the remaining eggplant.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C). When the tomato sauce is done, transfer ⅓ of the sauce to a small mixing bowl and the remainder to a large mixing bowl.\nLet the tomato sauce cool to room temperature, then add the eggs to the larger bowl of sauce and mix well to combine. If the sauce is too hot, you'll cook the eggs, so make sure it has cooled down.\nCover the bottom of a small 8- by 11-inch rectangular baking dish with a thin layer of the eggless tomato sauce, then add a layer of fried eggplant slices (use your biggest slices for this first layer; they can overlap a bit).  \nCover the eggplants with a layer of egg-tomato sauce, then a generous sprinkling of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, a sprinkling of chopped basil (if using), and then evenly distribute pieces of the mozzarella.\nCover the mozzarella with another layer of eggplant, then some egg-tomato sauce, Parmigiano, basil (if using), mozzarella, and then another layer of eggplant.\nRepeat until all of the ingredients are used up. The top layer should be the eggless tomato sauce, topped with a final sprinkling of grated Parmigiano. If you prefer a cheesier topping, sprinkle some mozzarella pieces on top as well.\nBake for 30 minutes, until the cheese on top is melted and golden brown. For the best results, let it sit for an hour.\nServe and enjoy."

I also baked the eggplant instead of boiling it and it turned out tender but not mushy. Probably would have been fine boiling it, I just don't have experience boiling eggplant and was comfortable with baking. They hardest thing about the recipe is waiting 5 minutes after it comes out of the oven before eating the whole pan."

I have to say that this is just incredibly delicious. If I had only known it was this good I would have had some back then.... ;) The sauce is so good! I used extra sharp and it's the perfect sauce for any kind of mac and cheese. Also I made it keto by just using full fat everything (such a sacrifice...) and using corn starch instead of flour for way less carbs. Thank you so much for sharing!"

To make up for the reduced meat, I added what I had: broccoli, bell pepper, and snow peas. If I was doing it again, I think I'd increase the sauce. Not sure I'd double it. I'll have to play with it to see what works. On the other hand, from my experience with the changes I made, I feel pretty certain the original recipe would have been just fine. One thing the changes I made did I think was to take away some of the spotlight on the basil."

First, I blended the sauce ingredients together in the vitamix and added a huge handful of cashews to it. I'm not sure this changed the flavor all that much, but it did make the sauce thicker, which some reviewers had complained about this recipe being too soupy. I agree with many others who said they used the whole can of coconut milk, I think this is absolutely necessary! I did not experience a soupy result at all, after reducing. I thought it was just perfect. I reduced the rice vinegar by 1 TB and juiced one lime into the wok at the very end of cooking instead. Also, I did add about 2 TB of sugar during cooking, which I'm glad I did. I did not find the fish sauce to be too salty or too overpowering (just don't try the sauce before cooking it!). Anyway, we loved it. Everyone went back for seconds, even my toddler!"

If you just use the Thai ingredients, ie, ginger (galanga), Thai basil, vegetable oil instead of evoo, Thai bird's eye chili peppers, Thai fish sauce (not absolutely necessary, but nice if you have it) and kiffer lime leaves as well as Thai soy sauce (if you happen to have) you will have better than restaurant results.\n\nHaving spent lots of time all over Thailand, a few cooking classes there and LOTS of Thai cooking, I appreciate the differences in many Asian dishes and recipes. The use of specific ingredients( when possible) takes recipes to a whole other level almost always making them better than restaurants."

Before cooking the chicken, I rinsed it well under cold water and used a paper towel to dry it as best I could. This gave the chicken a velvety texture and it wasn't dry or chewy at all.\n\nI used the veggies in the fridge, so ours was a little different. I had fresh broccoli, onion, and red and yellow peppers so that's what I used. \n\nFollowed the advice of other reviewers and used the whole can of full-fat coconut milk. \n\nI began by sautéing the veggies in sesame and olive oils in my very hot wok. After they were crisp-tender, I took them out and added a touch more sesame oil. Then stir-fried the chicken until it had a nice browned crust on both sides. Added just the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, fish sauce, and garlic chili paste (it's amazing for heat!) just as the chicken was almost done cooking; then added in the coconut milk and scraped up the bottom of the wok. I didn't have fresh basil this time so I just used dried (next time I will definitely try to use fresh, but dried gave it good flavor, too). Added the veggies back in and stirred well to get them in the sauce. Covered the wok and let the broccoli steam while I juiced 3 small limes and mixed in cornstarch to the lime juice. \n\nAfter the broccoli was steamed but still just a touch crisp, I added in the lime juice-cornstarch slurry and cooked it up until the sauce thickened a"

With the base of ingredients to create this you can simply modify this recipe to make it your own. I used more of the coconut milk than called for because, Sauce!!! The substitution of chili oil for cooking the chicken and then a dash or two of siratcha as well as some brown sugar into the coconut milk mixture took it to the next level for me. I highly recommend splurging on the Jasmine rice as an accompaniment."

I substituted baby bella mushrooms and it was still good.

Like others, I used the whole can of coconut milk. I also added more heat by using some garlic chili sauce (about 1 T.), and sweet chili sauce (about 2 T.). I think the sweet chili sauce made a big difference because it added some of sweetness which otherwise would have taken the finished dish down a notch. As it was, I also added some agave nectar when it was done because it seemed to need a little more of that signature Thai sweetness. I also put in more basil and added some rice noodles. Boy, this really was good. Only thing I might add next time would be some chopped peanuts."

The sour would have been better coming from lemon grass (lighter, better taste, a touch of sweetness), the fish sauce was wholly unnecessary, coconut cream would have made a thicker sauce, and the vinegar added nothing positive. However, it is so inconsequential in taste I don't think it's worth the effort to make it again to try those edits.\nEven after I added the rest of the can of coconut milk, I couldn't taste it past the odd salty, sour combo."

I think the idea for this recipe is good but one needs to use other ingredients to make it Thai. Use galangal if you can find it. It is expensive so don't waste it. Once found, slice it and use part for this dish. The rest can be sliced into 1/4\" slices and put into a jar filled with rice wine in the refrigerator for a month for future use. Use peanut oil, never olive oil in Thai dishes. Thai basil is a must, not Italian basil. The flavors are very different. For a more authentic touch use ground chicken or pork instead of diced chicken breast. Skip the pepper flakes and go for sliced chilis of whatever heat you wish. And lastly, want to feel like you are on the beach in Phuket ? Fry an egg sunny-side up and put an egg on each portion when serving this dish served atop Thai jasmine rice. Thanks for your submission of this dish, it has sparked many home chefs to experience another country's food without the price of an airplane ticket."

We also like it pretty spicy, so we use minced hot Thai chillis. (Or in a pinch, dry Thai chillis.) The point is though, this won't taste very authentic if you're using American pizzeria chili pepper flakes. (Which I'm not saying is what the recipe actually calls for. It just says red chili flakes, and that can mean a lot of things!)"

Methods and ingredients vary, but the recipe almost always calls for boneless pork shoulder, some sort of dark cola (usually Dr Pepper or root beer) and barbecue sauce. Dubious? We were too, so we asked the members of our NYT Cooking Community Facebook page if anyone had ever made it and if they liked it. We received more than 150 very opinionated responses. Many readers have come up with their own clever twists, like using coffee or beer in place of cola, adding onions or chipotles, rubbing the meat with a spice blend and searing the meat before cooking. We tried cooking it a few different ways and found we liked this adaptation best. It calls for a few more ingredients and an extra step or two, but it’s got layers of flavor and it’s still mostly fuss-free. (You can find the pressure-cooker version of this recipe here.)",

I'm thrilled that this is the recipe that I tried. Although it was time consuming and labor intensive it was absolutely AMAZING!! I used up our first-ever eggplants and shared the second casserole with friends! My husband liked it so well that he asked if eggplants were sold at the grocery store and if so, could we get them year round! I will definitely be making this again! Delicious!",

He had seconds and then we told him.  My one son hates vegetables, but will try somethings.  He loved it, too!  Even my fussy 11 year-old ate every bite!!  We will make this again!!

I am not a beginner cook but surely am not a great chef but that being said, even though this does take a little more prep time than usual, it is not difficult.

Put them on a greased sheet bake at 350 for 30 min turning once. I am trying to go gluten free for a while so I substituted gluten free flour. mix for the white flour and crushed rice chex cereal for the bread crumbs. Worked just fine and nobody even knew.

    "name": "Miso-Honey Chicken and Asparagus",
    "description": "This quick and easy sheet-pan meal is broiled instead of baked, which chars the marinade slightly on the chicken, browns the asparagus for maximum flavor and cuts the cooking time to around 10 minutes. The miso-honey mixture packs a punch, with lots of garlic, ginger and as much hot sauce as you like. It doubles as a marinade for the chicken and a sauce to spoon over the chicken and asparagus once cooked. Make sure to arrange the chicken thighs in a single layer, so they cook and char evenly, and keep an eye on the pan, as some broilers have hot spots. Feel free to substitute broccolini for the asparagus, and serve with steamed rice, if desired.",

Regarding the recipe, I never worked out how much eggplant is a large one so I have been using around 2.5 pounds. I think this may be a bit much because when I last made this and increased the amount of cumin and garlic, it tasted even better. I have made some short cuts to the recipe after I first made it according to what was written here. Instead of 4 large tomatoes, I now use a can of diced tomatoes which I think works just as well. While I started out with fresh parsley, I now use about 2 tablespoons of dried and it turns out well too with less hassle. It doesn't take me long to make this recipe and I have even less time due to a chopper I use for the eggplant."
